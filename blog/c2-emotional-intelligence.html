      This week I am beginning Chade-Meng Tan's book 'Search Inside Yourself' which speaks about emotional intelligence and how to apply it to your own life. Firstly; I should probably talk about what emotional intelligence is. This idea of emotional intelligence is something I've encountered before in my life but had never really delved too deep into so putting a firm foundation behind the idea really helped me to understand what was being talked about. Emotional intelligence was origional defined by as 'The ability to moniter one's own and other's feelings and emotions, the ability to discriminate or discern among those and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions'. This concept was summarised by Daniel Coleman into 5 key aspects. They are; Self-awareness, Self-regulation, Motivation, Empathy and Social Skills. So it is these domains or competencies that I will be focussing on as I journey through the teachings of Search Inside Yourself.

      So for me, it doesn't take much convincing to see that these are all very good things to be proficient in. The big question that arose is 'Where do I start?'. I didn't have to ask it for long though, because I got quite a succinct answer: Attention. The place to start was paying attention, particularly paying attention to your own body, Tan noted that what an emotional response is triggered, even before you are conciously aware of it, your body will begin to react. This reaction is different depending on the emotion but the experience is something that I'm sure we're all reasonably familiar with. It could be increased heart rate and sweating in situations of stress or perhaps tightening of the chest when you're beginning to become angry, the important thing is paying attention to your own body so that you can develop an understanding of what your own signs are and be able to take concious control of the situation before you do something you may regret. This is an idea I can get behind, there are so many things going on in the world around us that it is easy to forget to keep an eye on what is actually going on with yourself, we can easily get caught in the past or transfixed on what the future holds and forget to take in what the world as it is now.
