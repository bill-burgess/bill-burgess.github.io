      So this week I've been learning more about HTML and CSS, and I've stumbled into the beginnings of DOM through a company called Udacity. Basically, what it consisted of was a short (usually 2-3 minnute) tutorial on on one specific aspect of the code or how to use it, followed by a question that would require you to try it out for yourself to find the answer. For those of you who don't know what HTML, CSS and DOM are (Hi mum), one good way I've heard them explained is to think of them like a house. HTML is like the structure of the house; the walls, the ceiling, the floor etc. HTML dictates where different where the rooms are and whether they are a kitchen, a bathroom or whatever else you may have. If HTML is the house's struture, CSS is it's style. CSS can change our wallpapers and carpets, chooses where the coffee table goes and which coffee table we go for. With the exact same HTML and two different CSS you could end up with two very different looking webpages. DOM is a bit different, DOM is more like the blueprint you give to the builder, it has all the same information in it but it's set out in a way that our builder (Which is the web browser; Chrome, Firefox Safari etc.) understands it. The best thing about our builders though, is that unlike contractors, they're done almost instantly. So you can make changes in DOM to the style or content of the page and watch them happen in real time, this can be very helpful both in understanding what other web designers have done to make their pages or in playing around with ideas on your own.

      One thing that surpised me a little is that everything on a webpage is a rectangle, even cirles. Well, kind of, what I mean is that every element of a webpage is a rectangle, so a circle on a webpage is actually just a rectangle with part of it invisable. Seems stupid, I know, but the more you think about it the smarter it gets. You can break down the elements of any webpage into rectangles by simply drawing a box around the elements, this is called boxifying (Yes, that's the real technical term). This is actually really useful for a number of reasons, but firstly because our webpage is a box and so we can tessellate smaller boxes into really easily. What this means when you're building a page different elements will fit nicely around one another. There are plenty more reasons why we this helps us, but you'll have to tune in to part two to find out.
