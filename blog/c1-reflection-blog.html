        One thing I found very interesting in Shereef's chat was his take on expectations of learning, and the frame of mind that they lead to. Shereef refers to this with a restaurant metaphor, talking about the way a consumer of looks at education; like a customer ordering a set of skills, they pay their money and consume the education. He compares this to the idea of a group of chefs, all of very different experiences, in a kitchen working together to create something. The concept that education as something we do together is something which I think is largely overlooked in mainstream education, instead the focus more often turns to specific skills or abilities which you (idividually) need to learn to pass a test or qualify for a specific standard. I really like EDA's ethos that this is a shared experience, primarily between you and your cohort, but also with the teaching staff of EDA and all of the other people who help along the way.

        I feel that I have personally previously been a part of both types of environment, and while there are certainly some advantages of each, I far prefer the kitchen to the table. It's easy to work on a project by yourself, taking your experiences and skills and putting them into action but working with a group of strangers, all with different life experiences, different values and different priorties, can be extremely challenging. Learning these things about each other (especially in this kind of high intensity environment) will cause arguments and storms, but this is exactly why it's so useful. These differences which cause people to disagree and dispute are what allow us to look at challenges with a much wider scope, to see new angles on things we might not understand and to find the best approach to a problem. Of course I am nervous to throw myself headfirst into the arms of a dozen strangers, but all friends were once strangers.
