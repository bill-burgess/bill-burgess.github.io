      In part one I talked about boxifying and left you all with the biggest cliff hanger since 'Who shot JR?!'; what else is putting everything into boxes useful for? Amoung the other reasons I'm sure I'm yet to learn creating a grid based design is certainly one. Basically, what a grid based design is, is a way to devide up your webpage so that you can easily place elements around the page. This is done by firstly dividing the page up into columns, we generally will use 12 columns to divide the page, 12 is great because it is a superior highly compositive number, which basically just means it divides evenly into lots of other numbers but isn't too large, so that way you can have 1, 2, 3 or 4 columns of equal size on your webpage easily or countless numbers of variations of columns of different sizes. Then we create rows through the page with our elements and we can divide them into a grid as we do. This has revolutionised web design for me and I can't wait to get it implemented on my own blog (Hopefully already there by the time you read this). Anyway, that's grids, sorry for rambling on about how great 12 is, it's just that it's really great (Top 4 rational numbers for sure).

      One thing that's becoming more and more common is us using the the web on a variety of devices, in the past people would just go online from their home desktop (Because that's all there was) and that was that, but modern technology is producing more and more ways for us to view webpages, whether it be your desktop, laptop, netbook, tablet, phone or some weird new thing that only exists in Japan and Korea it's important that webpages we create are still functional and look good on them. That's where resposive webpages come in. A responsive webpage is one that will adapt and adjust when it's viewed on all sorts of different devices (or even in landscape vs portrait mode on some devices). The first problem is that all of these different devices have different sized screens, not just physical size but also the number of pixels in the screen. So this is going to cause some issues for things on our page which are set to a particular amount of pixels, luckily with our grid based design it's easy to scale our page as a percentage of the total page rather than a set number of pixels. We can even go one step further and have different elements of our page change when viewed on larger or smaller browsers or even go the whole hog like some pages do and redirect you to a seperate mobile friendly page when you view from mobile. All of these different ways of keeping your page functional and presentable are great and makes browsing on your phone, tablet or even VR headset all the more enjoyable.

      With all this going on, on one webpage things can get a little confusing. So it's important for us to use semantic tags when we are writing code. These simple little tags attached to the different elements of our page make sense to the web browser, but also to anyone else who might be looking at our code. Doing small things like having the h1, h2, h3 tags on your headings and img on your images really help people (including you) get what's going on in the code of your page and how it relates to the different elements you can see.
