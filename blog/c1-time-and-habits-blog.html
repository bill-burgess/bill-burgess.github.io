        To me, the concept of time management is daunting and alien (the fact that I am writing this at 6pm on a Sunday night is attestment to that), I have always been someone who doesn't plan their days, works for seemingly random amounts of time and leaves things to the last minute. I know that I could be much more efficient with my time if I regimented and stuck to my goals, I've simply never been that kind of person. So when I began learning about the Pomodoro Technique it seemed like something I could never stick to. But the more I learned, the more interesting I found it; the concept of stopping myself every 25 minutes to evaluate my progress seemed silly and counter productive, but as I saw how much those who practiced it raved about it's usefulness I decided to give it a go. <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com">Pomodorotechnique.com</a> gave me a challenge: to master their 6 steps to becoming a Certified Pomodoro Master(CPM), it was a very cheesy concept, but sometimes, just like with the tomatoes they've alikened themselves too, a bit of cheese is good.

        So I've set myself a goal; to master these 6 steps to becoming a CPM and in keeping with the theme of the excercise, I've set myself a time frame to complete it in. One week, over the next week I will be dilligent to apply the Pomodoro Technique to my work. At the end of my week, once I'm a CPM, I'll be able to assess the technique properly, it's merits and flaws and I'll be able to decide whether I was right all along, that it's just not my thing, or perhaps my mind will be changed on time management. Stay tuned.
